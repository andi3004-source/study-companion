/**
 * Imports the official HSK1-6 dataset (storage/app/seed-data/mandarin_hsk1to6_complete.json).
 *
 * HSK1 is NOT re-inserted: the existing 150 rows in mandarin_words drive the
 * Dashboard's day-by-day curriculum via batch_number/order_in_batch, and their
 * ids are referenced by user_word_progress, so they must keep their id, batch
 * and order. Instead we enrich each matched row in place with the columns the
 * curated data lacks (traditional, radical, frequency, ...) — never its
 * pinyin or meanings, which are curated and more reliable than this dataset
 * (see `php artisan hsk:repair-curriculum` for rows an older version of this
 * seeder already overwrote). 14 of the 150 curated hanzi have no exact match
 * in this dataset (different HSK standard/variant, e.g. "哪儿" vs "哪里") —
 * those rows are left untouched rather than guessed at.
 *
 * HSK2-6 (4,841 words) have no existing curriculum row, so they go into the
 * separate mandarin_hsk_words reference table used for browsing only.
